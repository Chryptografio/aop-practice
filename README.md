# AOP

There have been many failing tries to access users' accounts recently. That is why we want to log some information about accessing
accounts depending on what credentials people used to do so.

## Task

You have to make some changes in BadCredentialsLogger class, so all the tests would pass. You are allowed to add any annotations
you want and change method signatures as well.
